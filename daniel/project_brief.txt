Girlcrush.

App for sharing finds (products, recipes etc). 

User takes a photo, uploads w/ title, desc then tags GEO data, so others can view/use/purchase product.

Each user has own 'page' with list of posts.

Other users can up/downvote crushes.

App functions like tinder, quick swiping/clicking between posts. Only next is available.

If user upvotes another post, they will get a link in their account/dashboard sort of a favourites page.

Mix between Pinterest, Tinder and Lookbook
